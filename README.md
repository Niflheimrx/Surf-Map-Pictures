# Surf Map Pictures
This is a collection of pictures of surf maps from CSS/CS2/TF2, I use these pictures for my Garry's Mod community [Stellar Servers](https://stellarservers.net)

## Why?
Because why not, besides having a repository of surf images for server owners to use would be super handy when it comes to development. For example, these images are used for [Stellar Servers' SourceBans website](https://sourcebans.stellarservers.net) for map previews when clicking on a server info. I also use these images for our in-game server hopper addon so players can have a small glimpse of the map they are joining into.

# How to use
If you want to download every map and host it yourself, just clone the repository and use it for your needs. Otherwise you can use a direct link to get map images individually:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Niflheimrx/surf-map-images/main/pictures/[surf_map].jpg`

Change the URL to the name of the map obviously

# Contributing
There's 1000+ maps that currently exist somewhere in the surf world and we need images of each map (not including updated versions such as surf_antimatter and surf_antimatter_v2). Any amount of help would be greatly appreciated.
Here is how you can contribute:

- Image must be 2560x1440 (16:9) in JPEG format
- Must have a recognizable image that makes the map stand out
- Cannot have player models, zone outlines, or have anything visible that the map does not include
- Image filename must only be the map name, example: [surf_map].jpg
- One image per map, unless you want to add more in which you can name the file like this: [surf_map]-[number].jpg, don't go over 6 please.
